# New Hampshire 4,000'ers

This Python app obtains data for the 48 4,000'ers in New Hampshire. (Data is scraped from the AMC website.)


## scrape.py

This script calls other scripts (see below) which scrape web pages from the AMC website, then sends the data back in a JSON paylod by printing to stdout.

To Test in Terminal
 * Get data for all Mountains: `python3 scrape.py mountains /`
 * Get details for specific Mountain: `python3 scrape.py mountain /hiking-mount-washington.cfm`



## scrape_mountains.py

This script is called from scrape.py to scrape AMC's 4,000-Footer-Guide web page, then returns a JSON payload containing data for all Mountains.

		"mountainPic": "http://www.outdoors.org/story-images/images/Washington-StoryImage_2.jpg"
	}]
} 
```


## scrape_mountain.py
